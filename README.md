# Product Card UI â€“ Assessment Submission

This component implements a responsive and accessible Product Card based on real-world data and UI/UX best practices.

## ðŸ§© Layout Approach

The Product Card is built using a structured card-based layout with Bootstrap utility classes and React JSX. The content is segmented into logical sections:

- Product Image
- Title and (optional) Description and Pricing
- Variant Selector
- Price Display
- Action Buttons (Add to Cart or Out of Stock buttons conditional display)

## ðŸ“± Responsiveness Considerations

Responsiveness was achieved using Bootstrapâ€™s layout utilities. Key considerations include:

- `object-fit-contain` on the product image ensures it scales responsively within its container while preserving aspect ratio and avoiding distortion across all devices.
- The `<select>` tag uses `w-auto` to prevent it from stretching full width, keeping the form compact and mobile-friendly.
- Buttons and layout elements adapt gracefully to smaller screen sizes while maintaining readability and functionality.
